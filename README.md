# Test Svelte Project

This is just a project for me to test and mess around with Svelte.

Currently this just provides a skin for viewing MangaDex series data in a different layout inspired by the old vatoto.com but using the MangaDex Api.

Perhaps there will be more functionaity and improvements in the future.

## Running and Developing

Install the dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`).

To start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of this app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy this app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
